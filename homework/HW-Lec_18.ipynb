    "No matter how I seem to code the average number of attempts to find the ground state, it keeps on getting stuck on the same local minimum over and over, even when I rearrange the points. I'm sure I would find more variance with a higher number of atoms, but at least when numbers are relatively small it seems to either get it or not get it all. However, as the numbers get higher, the variance does increase enough that the optimization methods achieve different minimums, allowing the average to be more than one."
